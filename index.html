    <h1 style="color: white;">Budget request.</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">
        The vents would like to request 1000 dollars in budget from 3rd
        and 7th this year (we will also request the same amount
        from 1st st Margarets). You may notice that that is more
        than last year, and there is a reason for that. The 1400 dollar total
        budget was created with a much smaller company in mind, in fact it
        was decided when we had all of 7 vents. We now have 24-26 (my scouts
        Number-scout tracker number. I don’t know why they aren't the same)
        vents, which is nearly 4 times more, thus a budget increase may just
        be in order. You may be wondering what we’re going to do with it, well
        we did actually make a list.</p>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li style="color: white;" class="list">We expect to go to at aproxemetly 15 camps this year. Those usually come with expenses.</li>
            <li style="color: white;" class="list">We intend on going to the camp in maine which we expect to cost us around 400 $</li>
            <li style="color: white;" class="list">We are going on a large adventure this summer as we have no jamboree. I expect that to cost us around 500 $</li>
            <li style="color: white;" class="list">We do vents only camps every few months which means we need to book the some part of yoho those days.</li>
            <li style="color: white;" class="list">And finally other regular company expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white;">We hope you will consider this budget increase. We will be trying to remind people more often and forcefully to the bloody bottle box. Enjoy your meeting.</p>
